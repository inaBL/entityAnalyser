# enitityAnalyser
Personal project for analysing named entity treatment in texts, based on conceptual blending theory of semantic processing.

The pipelines are developed for faster automated processing of named entities and noun chunks.
The goal is to obtain the sentiment and topics attached to the entities, and enable data export to further platforms.
