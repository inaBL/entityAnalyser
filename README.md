# Entity Analyser
Personal project for analysing named entity treatment in texts, based on conceptual blending theory of semantic processing.

The goal is to obtain the sentiment and topics attached to the entities, and enable data export to further platforms.

Sentiment classes use the opinion lexicons by Hu and Liu:
